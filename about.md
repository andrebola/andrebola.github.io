<p>I currently work as a <b>Research Scientist</b> at SiriusXM-Pandora since 2022, focusing on multi-modal music recommender systems.</p>

<p>Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at <a href="https://mila.quebec/">Mila</a> & <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill</a>, working on <a href="https://musicairesearch.wordpress.com/projects/interdisciplinary-interventions/">interdisciplinary interventions in the design of music recommendation systems.</a></p>
	
<p>From 2015 to 2021, I worked at the <a href="http://mtg.upf.edu/research/labs/asp-lab">Music Technology Group</a> of <a href="http://upf.edu">Pompeu Fabra University</a> in Barcelona, Spain. I helped to create <a href="http://dunya.compmusic.upf.edu">Dunya</a> for the <a href="http://compmusic.upf.edu/">Compmusic</a> project. I also worked on developing <a href="http://freesound.org">Freesound</a> and research on music recommendation systems in collaboration with <a href="https://www.kakaocorp.com/?lang=en">Kakao</a>.</p>

<p>I completed the Ph.D. in 2021 at the MTG, my thesis is focused on studying the impact of music recommendations from the artists' side -trying to understand how these systems affect the artists and how an ethical recommender system could be more beneficial for them. In 2018, I completed my master's at Universidad de la Republica (Uruguay). My master thesis is about lyrics representations of Tango music.</p>
